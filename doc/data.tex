\chapter{Working with Data}
\label{ch:numerics}

In this chapter, we outline the facilities provided for simple numerical
analysis and data processing within PyXPlot.

\section{Tabulating Functions and Slicing Data Files}

PyXPlot's \indcmdt{tabulate} can be used to produce a text file containing the
values of a function at a set of points.  For example, the following would
produce a data file called {\tt sine.dat} containing a list of values of the
sine function:

\begin{verbatim}
set output 'sine.dat'
tabulate [-pi:pi] sin(x)
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Multiple functions may be tabulated into the same file, either by
using the \indmodt{using} modifier:

\begin{verbatim}
tabulate [0:2*pi] sin(x):cos(x):tan(x) u 1:2:3:4
\end{verbatim}

\noindent or by placing them in a comma-separated list, as in the {\tt plot}
command:

\begin{verbatim}
tabulate [0:2*pi] sin(x), cos(x), tan(x)
\end{verbatim}

The {\tt samples} setting can be used to control the number of points that are
inserted into the data file:\indcmd{set samples}

\begin{verbatim}
set samples 200
\end{verbatim}

\noindent If the $x$-axis is set to be logarithmic then the points at which the
functions are evaluated are spaced logarithmically.

The {\tt tabulate} command can also be used to select portions of data files
for output into a new file.  For example, the following would write out the
third, sixth and ninth columns of the datafile {\tt input.dat}, but only when
the arcsine of the value in the fourth column is positive:

\begin{verbatim}
set output 'filtered.dat'
tabulate 'input.dat' u 3:6:9 select (asin($4)>0)
\end{verbatim}

\noindent The \indmodt{select}, \indmodt{using} and \indmodt{every} modifiers
operate in the same manner as with the {\tt plot} command.

The format used in each column of the output file is chosen automatically with
integers and small numbers treated intelligently to produce output which
preserves accuracy, but is also easily human-readable. If desired, however, a
format statement may be specified using the {\tt with format} specifier. The
syntax for this is similar to that expected by the Python string substitution
operator ({\tt \%})\index{\% operator@{\tt \%} operator}\index{string
operators!substitution}\footnote{Note that this operator can also be used
within PyXPlot; see Section~\ref{sec:string_subs_op} for details.}.  For example,
to tabulate the values of $x^2$ to very many significant figures one could use:

\begin{verbatim}
tabulate x**2 with format "%27.20e"
\end{verbatim}

If there are not enough columns present in the supplied format statement it
will be repeated in a cyclic fashion; e.g. in the example above the single
supplied format is used for both columns.

\section{Function Fitting}
\label{sec:fit_command}

It is possible to fit functional forms to \datapoint s read from files by using
the \indcmdt{fit}. A simple example might be:\footnote{In \gnuplot, this
example would have been written {\tt fit f(x) ...}, rather than {\tt fit f()
...}. This syntax is supported in PyXPlot, but is deprecated.}

\begin{verbatim}
f(x) = a*x+b
fit f() 'data.dat' index 1 using 2:3 via a,b
\end{verbatim}

The first line specifies the functional form which is to be used.  The
coefficients within this function which are to be varied during the fitting
process are listed after the keyword \indkeyt{via} in the {\tt fit} command.
The modifiers \indmodt{index}, \indmodt{every} and
\indmodt{using}\indmod{select} have the same meanings here as in the plot
command.\footnote{The {\tt select} modifier, to be introduced in
Section~\ref{sec:select_modifier} can also be used.}  For example, given the
following data file which contains a sampled square wave, entitled {\tt
square.dat}:

\begin{verbatim}
    0.314159          1
    0.942478          1
    1.570796          1
    2.199115          1
    2.827433          1
    3.455752         -1
    4.084070         -1
    4.712389         -1
    5.340708         -1
    5.969026         -1
\end{verbatim}

\noindent the following script fits a truncated Fourier series to it.  The
output can be found in Example~\ref{ex:fitting}.

\begin{verbatim}
f(x) = a1*sin(x) + a3*sin(3*x) + a5*sin(5*x)
fit f() 'square.dat' via a1, a3, a5
set xlabel '$x$' ; set ylabel '$y$'
plot 'square.dat' title 'data' with points pointsize 2, \
     f(x) title 'Fitted function' with lines
\end{verbatim}

}

This is useful for producing best-fit lines\index{best fit
lines}\footnote{Another way of producing best-fit lines is to use a cubic
spline; more details are given in Section~\ref{sec:spline_command}}, and also has
applications for estimating the gradients of datasets.  The syntax is
essentially identical to that used by \gnuplot, though a few points are worth
noting:

\begin{itemize}
\item When fitting a function of $n$ variables, at least $n+1$ columns (or
rows -- see Section~\ref{sec:horizontal_datafiles}) must be specified after the
{\tt using} modifier. By default, the first $n+1$ columns are used. These
correspond to the values of each of the $n$ inputs to the function, plus
finally the value which the output from the function is aiming to match.
\item If an additional column is specified, then this is taken to contain the
standard error in the value that the output from the function is aiming to
match, and can be used to weight the \datapoint s which are input into the
{\tt fit} command.
\item By default, the starting values for each of the fitting parameters is
$1.0$. However, if the variables to be used in the fitting process are already
set before the {\tt fit} command is called, these initial values are used
instead. For example, the following would use the initial values
$\{a=100,b=50\}$:
\begin{verbatim}
f(x) = a*x+b
a = 100
b = 50
fit f() 'data.dat' index 1 using 2:3 via a,b
\end{verbatim}

\item As with all numerical fitting procedures, the {\tt fit} command comes
with caveats. It uses a generic fitting algorithm, and may not work well with
poorly behaved or ill-constrained problems. It works best when all of the
values it is attempting to fit are of order unity. For example, in a problem
where $a$ was of order $10^{10}$, the following might fail:
\begin{verbatim}
f(x) = a*x
fit f() 'data.dat' via a
\end{verbatim}
However, better results might be achieved if $a$ were artificially made of
order unity, as in the following script:
\begin{verbatim}
f(x) = 1e10*a*x
fit f() 'data.dat' via a
\end{verbatim}

\item A series of ranges may be specified after the {\tt fit} command, using
the same syntax as in the {\tt plot} command, as described in
Section~\ref{sec:plot_ranges}. If ranges are specified then only \datapoint s
falling within these ranges are used in the fitting process; the ranges refer
to each of the $n$ variables of the fitted function in order.

\item For those interested in the mathematical details, the workings of the
{\tt fit} command is discussed in more detail in Appendix~\ref{ch:fit_maths}.

\end{itemize}

At the end of the fitting process, the best-fitting values of each parameter
are output to the terminal, along with an estimate of the uncertainty in each.
Additionally, the Hessian, covariance and correlation matrices are output in
both human-readable and machine-readable formats, allowing a more complete
assessment of the probability distribution of the parameters.

\section{Datafile Interpolation}
\label{sec:spline_command}
\index{best fit lines}

The \indcmdt{interpolate} can be used to generate a special function with
PyXPlot which interpolates a set of \datapoint s supplied from a data file.
Various different types of interpolation are supported: linear interpolation,
power-law interpolation\footnote{Power-law interpolation is equivalent to
linear interpolation in log-log space.}, polynomial interpolation and
cubic-spline interpolation. The use of polynomial interpolation with large
datasets is strong discouraged, as polynomial fits tend to show severe
oscillations between \datapoint s.

The \indcmdt{interpolate} has similar syntax to the \indcmdt{fit}:

\begin{verbatim}
interpolate ( linear | loglinear | polynomial | spline )
            [<range specification>] <function name>() '<filename>' 
            [index <index specification>]
            [every <every specification>]
            [using <using specification>]
\end{verbatim}

A very common application of the \indcmdt{interpolate} is to perform arithmetic
functions such as addition or subtraction on datasets which are not sampled at
the same abscissa values. The following example would plot the difference
between two such datasets:

\begin{verbatim}
interpolate linear f() 'data1.dat'
interpolate linear g() 'data2.dat'
plot [min:max] f(x)-g(x)
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Note that it is advisable to supply a range to the {\tt plot} command
in this example: because the two datasets have been turned into continuous
functions, the {\tt plot} command has to guess a range to plot them over unless
one is explicitly supplied.

The functions have not, however, lost the range of the original data: because
it is generally very inadvisable to extrapolate interpolated function fits
beyond the limits of the \datapoint s used to constain the fit, PyXPlot returns
an error or NaN if this is attempted.

Smoothed splines can also be produced:

\begin{verbatim}
interpolate spline f() 'data1.dat' smooth 1.0
\end{verbatim}

\noindent where the value $1.0$ determines the degree of smoothing to apply;
the higher the value, the more smoothing is applied. The default behaviour is
not to smooth at all -- equivalent to {\tt smooth 0.0} -- and a value of $1.0$
corresponds to a moderate degree of smoothing.

The \indcmdt{spline} command is an alias for {\tt interpolate spline}; the
following two statements have equivalent meaning:

\begin{verbatim}
spline f() 'data1.dat'
interpolate spline f() 'data1.dat'
\end{verbatim}

\section{Numerical Integration and Differentiation}

\index{differentiation}\index{integration} Two special functions,
\indfunt{int\_dx()} and \indfunt{diff\_dx()}, may be used to numerically
integrate or differentiate an algebraic expressions.  In each case, the letter
{\tt x} is the dummy variable which is to be used in the integration or
differentiation, and may be replaced by any valid variable name of up to
16~characters in length.

The function {\tt int\_dx()} takes three parameters -- firstly the expression
to be integrated, which may optionally be placed in quotes, followed by the
minimum and maximum integration limits. These may have any physical dimensions,
so long as they match, but must both be real numbers. For example, the
following would plot the integral of the function $\sin(x)$:

\begin{verbatim}
plot int_dt('sin(t)',0,x)
\end{verbatim} 

The function {\tt diff\_dx()} takes two obligatory parameters plus one further
optional parameters. The first is the expression to be differentiated, which,
as above, may optionally placed in quotes for clarity. This should be followed
by the numerical value of the dummy variable at the point where the given
expression is to be differentiated. This value may have any physical
dimensions, and may be a complex number. When complex arithmetic is enabled,
PyXPlot checks that the function being differentiated satisfied the
Cauchy-Riemann equations, and returns an error if it does not to indicate that it
is not differentiable.  The final, optional, parameter to the {\tt diff\_dx()}
function is an approximate step size which indicates the range of argument
values over which PyXPlot should take samples to determine the gradient. If no
value is supplied, a value of $10^{-6}$ is used.  The following example would
evaluate the differential of the function $\cos(x)$ with respect to $x$ at
$x=1.0$:

\begin{dodo}
print diff\_dx('cos(x)', 1.0)
\end{dodo}

The following is an example of a function which is not differentiable, and
which throws an error because the Cauchy-Riemann equations are not satisfied:

\begin{dontdo}
pyxplot> set num comp
pyxplot> print diff\_dx(Re(sin(x)),1)
\end{dontdo}

Advanced users may be interested to know that \indfunt{int\_dx()} function is
implemented using the {\tt gsl\_integration\_qags()} function of the Gnu
Scientific Library\index{GSL}, and the \indfunt{diff\_dx()} function is
implemented using the {\tt gsl\_deriv\_central()} function of the same library.
Any caveats which apply to the use of these routines also apply to PyXPlot's
numerical calculus routines.

\section{Equation Solving and Searching for Minima and Maxima}

The \indcmdt{solve} can be used to numerically solve simple systems of
equations, as in the following example, which solves a simple pair of
simultaneous equations of two variables:

\begin{verbatim}
solve x+y=10, x-y=3 via x,y
\end{verbatim}

\noindent As in the {\tt fit} command, the list of variables which should be
varied to achieve a numerical fit should be supplied as a comma-separated list
after the word {\tt via}. No output is returned if the numerical solver
succeeds, otherwise an error message is displayed. If any of the fitting
variables are already defined prior to the \indcmdt{solve} being called, their
values are used as initial guesses, otherwise an initial guess of one for each
fitting variable is assumed.

The \indcmdt{solve} works by minimised the square residuals of all of the
equations supplied, and so even when no exact solution can be found, the best
compromise is returned. The following example has no solution -- a system of
three equations with two variables is over-constrained -- but PyXPlot
nonetheless finds a compromise solution:

\begin{verbatim}
solve x+y=10, x-y=3, 2*x+y=16 via x,y
\end{verbatim}

When complex arithmetic is enabled, the \indcmdt{solve} allows each fitting
variable to take any value in the complex plane, and thus the number of
dimensions of the fitting problem is effectively doubled, as in the following
example:

\begin{verbatim}
set numerics complex
solve abs(x)=2, arg(x)=90*unit(deg) via x
\end{verbatim}

The related \indcmd{minimise}\indcmd{maximise} {\tt minimise} and {\tt
maximise} commands can be used to find the minima or maxima of algebraic
expressions, for example:

\begin{verbatim}
x=0.1
minimise cos(x) via x
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Note that this example doesn't work when complex arithmetic is
enabled, since $\cos(x)$ diverges to $-\infty$ at $x=\pi+\infty i$.

Various caveats apply to all of the commands discussed in this section, which
are common to almost all numerical equation solvers. The {\tt solve}, {\tt
minimise} and {\tt maximise} commands can only claim to return the {\it
locally} optimum solution which is closest to the supplied initial guess, and
this may or may not be the {\it globally} optimum solution.

Furthermore, these commands usually work best when the optimum value they are
searching for is of order one, and if the convergence radius of this solution
is of at least similar magnitude. PyXPlot does attempt to correct cases where
the supplied initial guess turns out to be many orders of magnitude different
from the true solution, but cannot be gauranteed in these cases not to wildly
overshoot and produce unexpected results.

Wherever possible, it is strongly advised that the results returned by these
numerical solvers should be sanity checked.

\section{Histograms}

The \indcmdt{histogram} takes data from a file and bins it, producing a
function that represents the frequency distribution of the supplied data.  A
histogram is defined as a function consisting of discrete intervals, the area
under each of which is equal to the number of points binned in that interval.
For example:

\begin{verbatim}
histogram f() 'input.dat'
\end{verbatim}

\noindent would bin the points in the first column of the file {\tt input.dat}
into bins of unit width and produce a function $f()$, the value of which at any
given point was equal to the number of items in the bin at that point.

Modifiers can be supplied to the \indcmdt{histogram} command to control the bins
that it uses.  The \indmodt{binwidth} modifier sets the width of the bins used
and the \indmodt{binorigin} modifier their origin.  For example:

\begin{verbatim}
histogram wabbitcount() 'rabits.dat' binorigin 0.5 binwidth 2
\end{verbatim}

\noindent bins the rabbit data into bins between $0.5$ and $2.5$, $2.5$ and
$4.5$, etc.  Alternatively the \indmodt{bins} modifier allows an arbitrary set
of bins to be specified. For example the command:

\begin{verbatim}
histogram g() 'input.dat' bins (1, 2, 4)
\end{verbatim}

\noindent would bin the points in the first column of the file {\tt input.dat}
into two bins, $x=1\to 2$ and $x=2\to 4$.

A range can be supplied immediately following the command, using the same
syntax as in the {\tt plot} and {\tt fit} commands; only points that fall in
that range will then be binned.  In the same way as for the {\tt plot} command,
the \indmodt{index}, \indmodt{every}, \indmodt{using} and \indmodt{select}
modifiers can also be used to bin different portions of a datafile.

Note that, although a histogram is similar to a bar chart, they are subtly
different.  A bar chart has the {\it height} of the bar equal to the number of
points that it represents; for a histogram the {\it area} of the bar is equal to
the number of points.  To produce a bar chart use the histogram
command and then multiply by the bin width when plotting.

If the function produced by the histogram command is plotted using the
\indpst{boxes} plot style, box boundaries will be drawn to coincide with the
bins into which the data were sorted.
